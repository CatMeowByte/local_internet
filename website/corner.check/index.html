  <h1>CC0 1.0 Universal</h1>
  <p>Statement of Purpose</p>
  <p>The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").</p>
  <p>Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.</p>
  <p>For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to:
    <ul>
     <li>the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work</li>
     <li>moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s)</li>
     <li>publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work</li>
     <li>rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work</li>
     <li>rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work</li>
     <li>database rights</li>
     <li>other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work:
    <ul>
     <li>in all territories worldwide</li>
     <li>for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions)</li>
     <li>in any current or future medium and for any number of copies</li>
     <li>for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver")</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes.</li>
   <li>Limitations and Disclaimers.
    <ul>
     <li>No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.</li>
     <li>Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects.</li>
     <li>Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.</li>
